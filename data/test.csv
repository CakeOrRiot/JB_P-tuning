0,"In the old age, black was not counted fair, Or, if it were, it bore not beauty's name; But now is black beauty's successive heir, And beauty slandered with a bastard shame. For since each hand hath put on nature's power, Fairing the foul with art's false borrowed face, Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower, But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace. Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black, Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack, Sland'ring creation","with a false esteem. Yet so they mourn, becoming of their woe, That every tongue says beauty should look so."
1,"How oft, when thou, my music, music play'st Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st The wiry concord that mine ear confounds, Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap To kiss the tender inward of thy hand, Whilst my poor lips, which should that harvest reap, At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand. To be so tickled they would change their state And situation with those dancing chips, O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait, Making dead wood more blest","than living lips. Since saucy jacks so happy are in this, Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss."
2,"O, that you were your self! But, love, you are No longer yours than you yourself here live; Against this coming end you should prepare, And your sweet semblance to some other give. So should that beauty which you hold in lease Find no determination; then you were Your self again after yourself's decease When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear. Who lets so fair a house fall to decay, Which husbandry in honor might uphold Against the stormy gusts of winter's day And barren rage of death's","eternal cold? O, none but unthrifts, dear my love, you know. You had a father; let your son say so."
3,"O, how thy worth with manners may I sing When thou art all the better part of me? What can mine own praise to mine own self bring, And what is 't but mine own when I praise thee? Even for this let us divided live And our dear love lose name of single one, That by this separation I may give That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone. O absence, what a torment wouldst thou prove Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave To entertain the time with thoughts of love, Which time and thoughts so","sweetly doth deceive, And that thou teachest how to make one twain By praising him here who doth hence remain."
4,"O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide, The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds, That did not better for my life provide Than public means which public manners breeds. Thence comes it that my name receives a brand; And almost thence my nature is subdued To what it works in, like the dyer's hand. Pity me, then, and wish I were renewed, Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection; No bitterness that I will bitter think, Nor double penance, to","correct correction. Pity me, then, dear friend, and I assure ye Even that your pity is enough to cure me."
5,"Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art, As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel; For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel. Yet in good faith some say that thee behold, Thy face hath not the power to make love groan; To say they err I dare not be so bold, Although I swear it to myself alone. And, to be sure that is not false I swear, A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face, One on another's neck do witness bear Thy black is fairest in","my judgment's place. In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds, And thence this slander as I think proceeds."
6,"Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments. Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove. O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wand'ring bark, Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle's compass come; Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, But bears it out even to","the edge of doom. If this be error, and upon me proved, I never writ, nor no man ever loved."
7,"Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly? Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy. Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly, Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy? If the true concord of well-tuned sounds, By unions married, do offend thine ear, They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear. Mark how one string, sweet husband to another, Strikes each in each by mutual ordering, Resembling sire and child and happy mother Who, all in one, one","pleasing note do sing; Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one, Sings this to thee: ""Thou single wilt prove none."""
8,"Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all. What hast thou then more than thou hadst before? No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call; All mine was thine before thou hadst this more. Then, if for my love thou my love receivest, I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest; But yet be blamed if thou thyself deceivest By willful taste of what thyself refusest. I do forgive thy robb'ry, gentle thief, Although thou steal thee all my poverty; And yet love knows it is a greater grief To bear love's wrong than hate's","known injury. Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows, Kill me with spites, yet we must not be foes."
9,"If the dull substance of my flesh were thought, Injurious distance should not stop my way, For then, despite of space, I would be brought From limits far remote, where thou dost stay. No matter then although my foot did stand Upon the farthest earth removed from thee, For nimble thought can jump both sea and land As soon as think the place where he would be. But, ah, thought kills me that I am not thought, To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone, But that, so much of earth and water wrought, I","must attend time's leisure with my moan; Receiving nought by elements so slow But heavy tears, badges of either's woe."
10,"Let not my love be called idolatry, Nor my beloved as an idol show, Since all alike my songs and praises be To one, of one, still such, and ever so. Kind is my love today, tomorrow kind, Still constant in a wondrous excellence; Therefore my verse, to constancy confined, One thing expressing, leaves out difference. ""Fair, kind, and true"" is all my argument, ""Fair, kind, and true,"" varying to other words; And in this change is my invention spent, Three themes in one, which","wondrous scope affords. ""Fair,"" ""kind,"" and ""true"" have often lived alone, Which three till now never kept seat in one."
11,"When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see, For all the day they view things unrespected; But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee And, darkly bright, are bright in dark directed. Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright, How would thy shadow's form form happy show To the clear day with thy much clearer light When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so! How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made By looking on thee in the living day, When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!","All days are nights to see till I see thee, And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me."
12,"O, call not me to justify the wrong That thy unkindness lays upon my heart; Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue; Use power with power, and slay me not by art. Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight, Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside. What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might Is more than my o'erpressed defense can bide? Let me excuse thee: ah, my love well knows Her pretty looks have been mine enemies; And therefore from my face she turns my foes, That they elsewhere might dart their","injuries. Yet do not so; but since I am near slain, Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain."
13,"O, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem By that sweet ornament which truth doth give. The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem For that sweet odor which doth in it live. The canker blooms have full as deep a dye As the perfumed tincture of the roses, Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly When summer's breath their masked buds discloses; But, for their virtue only is their show, They live unwooed and unrespected fade, Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so; Of their sweet deaths are","sweetest odors made. And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth, When that shall vade, by verse distils your truth."
14,"Lo, as a careful huswife runs to catch One of her feathered creatures broke away, Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch In pursuit of the thing she would have stay, Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase, Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent To follow that which flies before her face, Not prizing her poor infant's discontent; So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee, Whilst I, thy babe, chase thee afar behind. But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me And play the mother's part: kiss me, be","kind. So will I pray that thou mayst have thy will, If thou turn back and my loud crying still."
