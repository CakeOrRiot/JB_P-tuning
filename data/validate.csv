0,"Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid, My verse alone had all thy gentle grace; But now my gracious numbers are decayed, And my sick muse doth give another place. I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument Deserves the travail of a worthier pen; Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent He robs thee of and pays it thee again. He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word From thy behavior; beauty doth he give And found it in thy cheek. He can afford No praise to thee but what in thee doth","live. Then thank him not for that which he doth say, Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay."
1,"Ah, wherefore with infection should he live, And with his presence grace impiety, That sin by him advantage should achieve And lace itself with his society? Why should false painting imitate his cheek And steal dead seeing of his living hue? Why should poor beauty indirectly seek Roses of shadow, since his rose is true? Why should he live, now Nature bankrout is, Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins, For she hath no exchequer now but his, And, proud of many, lives upon his","gains? O, him she stores, to show what wealth she had In days long since, before these last so bad."
2,"Your love and pity doth th' impression fill Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow; For what care I who calls me well or ill, So you o'ergreen my bad, my good allow? You are my all the world, and I must strive To know my shames and praises from your tongue; None else to me, nor I to none alive, That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong. In so profound abysm I throw all care Of others' voices that my adder's sense To critic and to flatterer stopped are. Mark how with my",neglect I do dispense: You are so strongly in my purpose bred That all the world besides methinks are dead.
3,"Those hours that with gentle work did frame The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell Will play the tyrants to the very same And that unfair which fairly doth excel; For never-resting time leads summer on To hideous winter and confounds him there, Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone, Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness everywhere. Then, were not summer's distillation left A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass, Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft, Nor it nor no remembrance","what it was. But flowers distilled, though they with winter meet, Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet."
4,"That time of year thou mayst in me behold When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang Upon those boughs which shake against the cold, Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang. In me thou see'st the twilight of such day As after sunset fadeth in the west, Which by and by black night doth take away, Death's second self, that seals up all in rest. In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire That on the ashes of his youth doth lie, As the death-bed whereon it must expire, Consumed with that which it was nourished","by. This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong, To love that well which thou must leave ere long."
5,"Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame Is lust in action; and, till action, lust Is perjured, murd'rous, bloody, full of blame, Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust; Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight; Past reason hunted, and no sooner had, Past reason hated as a swallowed bait On purpose laid to make the taker mad. Mad in pursuit and in possession so; Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme; A bliss in proof and proved a very woe; Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream.","All this the world well knows, yet none knows well To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell."
6,"When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes, I all alone beweep my outcast state, And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, And look upon myself and curse my fate, Wishing me like to one more rich in hope, Featured like him, like him with friends possessed, Desiring this man's art and that man's scope, With what I most enjoy contented least; Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising, Haply I think on thee, and then my state, Like to the lark at break of day arising From sullen earth, sings hymns at",heaven's gate; For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
7,"Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me, Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain, Have put on black, and loving mourners be, Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain. And truly not the morning sun of heaven Better becomes the gray cheeks of the east, Nor that full star that ushers in the even Doth half that glory to the sober west As those two mourning eyes become thy face. O, let it then as well beseem thy heart To mourn for me, since mourning doth thee grace, And suit thy pity","like in every part. Then will I swear beauty herself is black, And all they foul that thy complexion lack."
8,"Those lines that I before have writ do lie, Even those that said I could not love you dearer; Yet then my judgment knew no reason why My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer. But reckoning time, whose millioned accidents Creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings, Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents, Divert strong minds to th' course of alt'ring things-- Alas, why, fearing of time's tyranny, Might I not then say ""Now I love you best,"" When I was certain o'er incertainty, Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?","Love is a babe. Then might I not say so, To give full growth to that which still doth grow."
9,"O, how I faint when I of you do write, Knowing a better spirit doth use your name, And in the praise thereof spends all his might, To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame. But since your worth, wide as the ocean is, The humble as the proudest sail doth bear, My saucy bark, inferior far to his, On your broad main doth willfully appear. Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride, Or, being wracked, I am a worthless boat, He of tall building and of","goodly pride. Then, if he thrive and I be cast away, The worst was this: my love was my decay."
10,"O, lest the world should task you to recite What merit lived in me that you should love, After my death, dear love, forget me quite, For you in me can nothing worthy prove; Unless you would devise some virtuous lie, To do more for me than mine own desert, And hang more praise upon deceased I Than niggard truth would willingly impart. O, lest your true love may seem false in this, That you for love speak well of me untrue, My name be buried where my body is And live no more to shame nor me nor","you. For I am shamed by that which I bring forth, And so should you, to love things nothing worth."
11,"Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind, And that which governs me to go about Doth part his function, and is partly blind, Seems seeing, but effectually is out; For it no form delivers to the heart Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch; Of his quick objects hath the mind no part, Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch. For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight, The most sweet favor or deformed'st creature, The mountain or the sea, the day or night, The crow or dove, it","shapes them to your feature. Incapable of more, replete with you, My most true mind thus maketh mine eye untrue."
12,"Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war How to divide the conquest of thy sight. Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar, My heart mine eye the freedom of that right. My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie, A closet never pierced with crystal eyes; But the defendant doth that plea deny, And says in him thy fair appearance lies. To 'cide this title is impaneled A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart, And by their verdict is determined The clear eyes' moiety and the dear","heart's part, As thus: mine eyes' due is thy outward part, And my heart's right, thy inward love of heart."
13,"But be contented when that fell arrest Without all bail shall carry me away, My life hath in this line some interest, Which for memorial still with thee shall stay. When thou reviewest this, thou dost review The very part was consecrate to thee. The earth can have but earth, which is his due; My spirit is thine, the better part of me. So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life, The prey of worms, my body being dead, The coward conquest of a wretch's knife, Too base of thee to","be remembered. The worth of that is that which it contains, And that is this, and this with thee remains."
14,"From fairest creatures we desire increase, That thereby beauty's rose might never die, But, as the riper should by time decease, His tender heir might bear his memory. But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes, Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel, Making a famine where abundance lies, Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel. Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament And only herald to the gaudy spring Within thine own bud buriest thy content And, tender churl, mak'st waste","in niggarding. Pity the world, or else this glutton be-- To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee."
15,"If thy soul check thee that I come so near, Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy will, And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there. Thus far for love my love-suit, sweet, fulfill. Will will fulfill the treasure of thy love, Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one. In things of great receipt with ease we prove Among a number one is reckoned none. Then in the number let me pass untold, Though in thy store's account I one must be. For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold That nothing me, a something, sweet, to thee.","Make but my name thy love, and love that still, And then thou lovest me, for my name is Will."
